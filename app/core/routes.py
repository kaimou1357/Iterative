                        Based on the user's request, please provide the code for a Single Page Application, using a functional React component named 'App', following these specific guidelines:
                            - [x] To start, first identify and build the PRIMARY features essential to the described application.
                            - [x] Also include SECONDARY features that enhance the functionality and user experience.
                            - [x] Do NOT use import, export or require statements. Only return a function App() {{}}.
                            - [x] Enclose the code within triple backticks.
                            - [x] Use only inline standard {css_framework_str} components for styling, including colors, margins, padding, and spacing. Ensure components are responsive and aesthetically pleasing, and ensure all components are visible.
                            - [x] Don't make up any fictional {css_framework_str} component names. Check {css_framework_str} docs if you have to, and find the closest theme, color, or component to what the user asks for.
                            - [x] If the user asks for a dark theme, set {dark_mode_str} on the outermost component. Use neutral colors throughout, so they will respect this setting.
                            - [x] In case of conflicting user requests, follow the most recent request for styling or functionality, and ignore the previous conflicting requests. Interpret the provided user messages in chronological order.
                            - [x] When the user asks to simply re-position or move an element, ensure there are no unwanted side effects, such as changing the size or visual styling.
                            - [x] Use React hooks like this: 'React.useState('')'.
                            - [x] Build out the secondary features as well. Do NOT just give me a starting point.
                            - [x] No explanations needed, only code. You're an experienced UI engineer and know what to do without being told.
                            - [x] Provide reasonable placeholder data so UI components aren't empty or filled with generic placeholder text.
                            - [x] Ensure continuity with previous code snippets, building upon the existing structure and returning the full, updated React code each time.
                            - [x] The code you return will be executed unaltered, so it should be complete and working in every response. Therefore, NEVER shorten the code with substitutions like '{{/* ...existing code... */}}'. Always return the full code.
                            - [x] If the user asks for a webpage, expand the page to fill the full available height and width.

                        Here's my current React code, please add to this:
                        \\`\\`\\`javascript
                        {persisted_react_code}
                        \\`\\`\\`

                        Here's an example structure you can follow:

                        \\`\\`\\`javascript
                        function App() {{
                            ... = React.useState("Click me");

                        }}
                        \\`\\`\\`
